## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development


First I made a container for all the elements, then I put a QR code image and then I added the texts,
Then I started adding the style to all the elements, I used Flexbox and then adjusted the elements to responsive to all the screens


### Useful resources

- [HTML Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp?) - This site helped me choose and convert colors to different formats.
- [CSS Flex Container](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox container. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
